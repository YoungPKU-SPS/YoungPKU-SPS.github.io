## Rationale & Objective
To characterize associations between long-term visit-to-visit variability of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and risk of adverse kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes.

## Study Design
Observational study.

## Setting & Participants
93,598 adults with diabetes undergoing routine care in Stockholm, Sweden.

## Exposures and Predictors
Categories of baseline and time-varying HbA1c variability score (HVS, the percentage of total HbA1c measures that vary by >0.5% [5.5 mmol/mol] during a 3-year window): 0-20%, 21%-40%, 41%-60%, 61%-80%, and 81%-100%, with 0-20% as the reference group.

## Outcome
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression (composite of >50% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decline and kidney failure), acute kidney disease (AKI by clinical diagnosis or transient creatinine elevations according to KDIGO criteria), and worsening of albuminuria.

## Analytical Approach
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

## Results
Compared with persons showing low HbA1c variability (HVS 0-20%), any increase in variability was associated with a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes beyond mean HbA1c. For example, for patients with a baseline HbA1c variability of 81%-100%, the adjusted HR was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.47-1.74) for CKD progression, 1.23 [1.16-1.3] for AKI, and 1.28 [1.21-1.36] for worsening of albuminuria. The results were consistent across subgroups (diabetes subtypes, baseline eGFR, or albuminuria categories), in time-varying analyses and in sensitivity analyses including time-weighted average HbA1c or alternative metrics of variability.

## Limitations
Observational study, limitations of claims data, lack of information on diet, body mass index, medication changes, and diabetes duration.

## Conclusions
Higher long-term visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is consistently associated with the risks of CKD progression, AKI, and worsening of albuminuria.

## Plain-Language Summary
The evidence for current guideline recommendations derives from clinical trials that focus on a single HbA1c as the definitive measure of efficacy of an intervention. However, long-term visit-to-visit fluctuations of HbA1c may provide additional value in the prediction of future kidney complications. We evaluated the long-term fluctuations in glycemic control in almost 100,000 persons with diabetes undergoing routine care in Stockholm, Sweden. We observed that higher long-term HbA1c fluctuation is consistently associated with the risks of chronic kidney disease progression, worsening of albuminuria and acute kidney injury. This finding supports a role for long-term glycemic variability in the development of kidney complications and illustrates the potential usefulness of this metric for risk stratification at the bedside beyond a single HbA1c test.
